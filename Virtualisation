What is meant by Virtualisation?

 - Virtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of physical resources, such 
as servers, storage devices, networks, or operating systems, by using software to abstract 
and allocate these resources, enabling multiple virtual environments to run simultaneously
on a single physical system.


In hardware virtualization, the host machine is the machine that is used by the virtualization and
the guest machine is the virtual machine. The words host and guest are used to distinguish the software 
that runs on the physical machine from the software that runs on the virtual machine. The software or firmware
that creates a virtual machine on the host hardware is called a hypervisor or virtual machine monitor.[2] Hardware
virtualization is not the same as hardware emulation. Hardware-assisted virtualization facilitates building a virtual machine monitor 
and allows guest OSes to be run in isolation.


What is Hypervisor?
A hypervisor is software that lets you run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical computer.  Each VM acts like a separate computer,
with its own operating system and applications, while sharing the physical hardware—like CPU, memory, and storage—managed by the hypervisor. 

Think of it as a virtual machine manager that divides the physical machine’s resources and assigns them to each VM, ensuring they run independently and securely.  
This allows organizations to use hardware more efficiently, reduce costs, and run different operating systems on one server. 
Type 1 (Bare-metal): Runs directly on the hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V). Best for enterprise environments due to high performance and security. 
Type 2 (Hosted): Runs on top of an existing operating system (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation). Easier to set up, ideal for testing or personal use.
